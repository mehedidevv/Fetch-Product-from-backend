# Fetch Product List From Backend

In Flutter, fetching a product list from the backend involves making an API call, processing the response, and displaying the data in the UI. Typically, you use an HTTP client or a service class to request data from a server. The response, usually in JSON format, is parsed into model objects. You can manage the loading state, handle offline scenarios, and cache the data for a smooth user experience. Flutter’s state management solutions like GetX help efficiently update the UI when the data changes.
